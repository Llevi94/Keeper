# Keeper_Project
------------------
Keeper is a Fullstack project designed to simplify the process of capturing thoughts, notes, or lists. With Keeper, users can effortlessly jot down their ideas or to-do lists, keeping everything organized and accessible in one place.<br>
<br>
<br>

Keeper is MERN project - MongoDB was utilized as the database to store and manage data efficiently. 
<br>Express.js provided a robust backend framework, while Node.js facilitated server-side scripting. 
<br>On the frontend, React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces. 
<br>The project was predominantly built using JavaScript for both backend and frontend logic, with HTML and CSS utilized for structuring and styling the user interface.
<br><br>
In the deployment process of the Keeper project, I made a strategic decision to utilize Vercel. This platform was selected due to its capability to seamlessly segregate server-side and client-side components, thereby guaranteeing a scalable and modular architecture.
