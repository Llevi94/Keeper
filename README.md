# Keeper Project

Keeper is a full-stack project aimed at simplifying the process of capturing thoughts, notes, or lists. Users can effortlessly jot down their ideas or to-do lists, keeping everything organized and accessible in one place.

## Technologies Used

Keeper is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project:

- **MongoDB**: Utilized as the database to store and manage data efficiently.
- **Express.js**: Provided a robust backend framework.
- **Node.js**: Facilitated server-side scripting.
- **React.js**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Predominantly used for both backend and frontend logic.
- **HTML and CSS**: Utilized for structuring and styling the user interface.

## Deployment Strategy

In the deployment process of the Keeper project, a strategic decision was made to utilize Vercel. This platform was chosen for its capability to seamlessly segregate server-side and client-side components, thereby guaranteeing a scalable and modular architecture.
